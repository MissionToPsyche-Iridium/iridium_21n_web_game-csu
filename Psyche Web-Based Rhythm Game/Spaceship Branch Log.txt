Updated Movement Script

Created a void function called "updateMovement" to avoid repetition. The function
takes a float parameter. The parameter is the button which the user pressed.

Created an "rotating animation" for the spaceship:

Methods:

ScaleTransform(IEnumerator for delay): This method runs a while loop that goes until the 
duration is reached(.20 seconds in this case). Each iteration is saved and returned 
as shown during the game due to both the method and its return type.

Var t is the ratio of the elapsed time divided by duration. The final result is 1 which is used later.

ElapsedTime += Time.DeltaTime adds time to ElapsedTime each iteration starting from 0. 
Vector3.Lerp - takes 3 parameters. The first 2 parameters are used to interpolate between two points. These two points are: The beginning of the "initialScale" and "targetScale" 
the last parameter, "t,"  is by how much we want to gradually move the object between those points. 
As t increases from 0 to 1, it moves closer to "targetScale"
Once t reaches 1, the transition/movement has ended. 

ResetScale() function simply resets the localScale of the object to its initial state.
