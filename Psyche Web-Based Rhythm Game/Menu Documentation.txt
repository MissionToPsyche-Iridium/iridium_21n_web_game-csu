Changes that happened in UI :
- added ui of pausemenu to scale with webbroswer specs
- removed resume button and just added instructions

Added the following changes to Manager.cs:
1) The pause and resume functions have been condensed to a toggle by using a boolean.
2) The pause and resume are now assigned to the same escape (same as the pausemenu)
3) Moved the call function for song into lanes.cs from manager.cs

Added the following changes to Lanes.cs:
1) Added two functions pause and resume game
2) Variable pause added
3) For line 36 we need the line to pause all the notes. If it doesnt go throught the loop itll only pause one.

Added the following changes to Notes.cs:
1) Added private bool isPaused=false - a boolean that indicates it the indivisual note is actually paused.

Added the following changes to PauseMenu.cs 
2) When a certain key is press it will call on the function with the PauseMenu.cs ( escape brings up the pausemenu ui and pause the games).
