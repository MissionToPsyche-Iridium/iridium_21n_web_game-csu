Changes that happened:
- Added Health/Fuel Bar that will depleted everytime the user moves the satellite
- Added the correct sprite for both fuel and satellite
- Adjusted the game screen adaptability that the game scales properly for any given screen
- Change the following scripts: Manager.cs, Movement.cs
- Deleted the following script(s): Asteroid.cs
- Organized SampleScene GameObjects

Added the following changes to Manager.cs:
1) public image healthBar: To control the game object(the health bar displayed in the game) programmically
2) public float satelliteFuel: To assign the total health/fuel of the health bar/fuel bar, this variable will
be utilized to add or deplete fuel accordingly.
3) tapYCoordinate changed from -3 -> -271 (Needed for adaptable screen)
4) spawnYCoordinate changed from 7 -> 400 (Needed for adaptable screen)
5) Added useFuel void function: Conditional logic that manages the fuel of the game. Every time the player
presses a key, -1 fuel will be subtracted from the total fuel
6) Added gainFuel() void function: Conditional logic that manages how the player gains fuel. 
Every time the user manages to tap a key on time(if it is a hit/ if hit() is called) then
the user gains +2 fuel points.
7) Added public static void Hit(): Here we call if gainUse() function so user can gain fuel if
he taps the key within the margin of error
8) Added public static void Miss(): Currently this function only re-assigns the value of pointStreak variable
which will be later user for scoring.
9) Added a conditional statement inside of Update(): If the satellite fuel we prompt the console to log "Game Over"
Ideally we want to use this function to terminate the game as it is game over.

Added the following changes to Movement.cs:
1) Added 4 GameObject variables Lane1~4: This will be to assign the Lanes position from Lane.cs to the Movement
of the satellite. For example, if Lane1 x position is 300, then we want to get that position from the game object, then
we want to assign the x-axis(300 in this case) to buttonA which will teleport the satellite to the 300 x-axis once button A 
is pressed
2) Deleted movement distance as it is no longer needed due to the #1 change stated above.
3) Adjusted the control variables(ButtonA,D,F,S) to its respective value according to each lane; for example:
ButtonD -> assigned the x-axis position of lane3. 

Added the following changes to SampleScene:
1) Created a "SpaceCanvas" canvas that holds lanes 1~4 and the satellite sprite to ensure
these items are scale with the screen size.
2) Created a "healthBar" canvas which is similar to the Canvas above. Both canvas are set to
scale with the screen size. 
3) Added reference resolution inside all canvas to 1920x1080
4) Added Render Camera: Main Camera(Camera) to all canvas to avoid items/game object not being shown or
not being shown properly
5) Changed the x-axis location of all the lanes according to the canvas SpaceCanvas
6) Changed the x and y-axis coordinates of the satellite according to the canvas 
7) Changed the x and y **Scale** variable under "transform" for all the lanes to x: 2, y: 1.5
Note: Changing this value(the scale coordinate of the lanes) will adjust the size of the note
In this case, it will change the size of the fuel sprite.
