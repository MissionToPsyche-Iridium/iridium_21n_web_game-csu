UI Changes:
- Changed sorting layer of the fuel order prefab 0 -> 1
- Added "Background" Canvas
- Added "VideoScreen" Raw Image inside of Background Canvas UI
- Added "VideoPlayer" GameObject

Manager.cs Script changes:
- Added 3 new variables to control UI:
1) public RawImage rawImageUI (Changed Rect Transform to strecth both horizontally and vertically to ensure it is fitting the screen size)
2) public RenderTexture renderTexture
3) public VideoPlayer videoPlayer;

- Added new function called "StartVideoDisplay()"
1) In this function the video starts playing and assigns the correct texture/video VideoScreen

-Video quality(Background):

Due to limitation of Github only allowing 100KB, I needed to reduce the video quality. 

- Added the following to void Start():
string path = Application.streamingAssetsPath + "/fullLevelsPsyche.mp4";
            videoPlayer.source = VideoSource.Url;
            videoPlayer.url = path;
            videoPlayer.Prepare();

The code of lines above make sure that the video is uploaded to the web and is playing the correct uploaded version in webGL
Added:
videoPlayer.url = Application.streamingAssetsPath + "/fullLevelsPsyche.mp4";
Instead of dragging and dropping asset, changed to programically select the correct mp4 video file.

Added a new function called "delayStart()"
- As the name implies, this function delays the start of the game by .5seconds to ensure everything loads before the game starts.
